# âœ… Hybrid Models Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented and integrated **two new hybrid models** using advanced ensemble techniques to the existing injury prediction system.

## ðŸŽ¯ New Models Added

### 1. **Ensemble 6: AdaBoost + Gradient Boosting + Extra Trees**
- **F1-Score (Severity)**: 0.9199 (5th place)
- **F1-Score (Location)**: 0.7545 (6th place)
- **Technique**: Weighted soft voting with diverse boosting methods

### 2. **Ensemble 7: Blending with Meta-Learning**
- **F1-Score (Severity)**: 0.9219 (4th place)
- **F1-Score (Location)**: 0.7436 (7th place)
- **Technique**: Two-level stacking with neural network meta-learner

## ðŸ“Š Performance Results

### Best Overall Models:
- **Severity Prediction**: Ensemble 2 (RF+XGB+NN) - F1: 0.9275
- **Location Prediction**: Ensemble 4 (Bagging) - F1: 0.7820

### New Models Performance:
- Both new models achieved **F1-scores > 0.92** for severity prediction
- Both new models achieved **F1-scores > 0.74** for location prediction
- **Competitive performance** with existing best models
