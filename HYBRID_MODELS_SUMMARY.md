# Hybrid Models Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and integrated two new hybrid models using advanced ensemble techniques to the existing injury prediction system.

## New Hybrid Models Added

### 1. Ensemble 6: AdaBoost + Gradient Boosting + Extra Trees
- **Technique**: Voting Classifier with weighted soft voting
- **Components**: 
  - AdaBoost with Decision Tree base estimator
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Extra Trees Classifier
- **Weights**: [1.2, 1.0, 0.8] (AdaBoost gets highest weight)

### 2. Ensemble 7: Blending with Meta-Learning
- **Technique**: Two-level Stacking Classifier

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `scripts/new_hybrid_models.py` - Standalone script for new hybrid models
- `scripts/updated_advanced_hybrid.py` - Comprehensive ensemble comparison
- `HYBRID_MODELS_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files:
- `scripts/model_training.py` - Added new hybrid models to main training pipeline
- `results/updated_advanced_hybrid/` - New results directory with all ensemble models

## Model Integration

The new hybrid models are now fully integrated into the existing training pipeline and can be used alongside the original models. They are saved in the `results/` directory and can be loaded for prediction in the Flask application.

## Recommendations

1. **For Severity Prediction**: Use Ensemble 2 (RF+XGB+NN) - highest F1-score
2. **For Location Prediction**: Use Ensemble 4 (Bagging) - highest F1-score
3. **For Balanced Performance**: Consider Ensemble 6 (AdaBoost+GB+ExtraTrees) - good performance on both tasks
4. **For Advanced Applications**: Use Ensemble 7 (Blending+MetaLearning) - sophisticated meta-learning approach

## Next Steps

1. Update Flask app to use best performing models
2. Implement model selection based on performance metrics
3. Add model comparison visualization
4. Consider hyperparameter tuning for further improvements
